/**
 * Abstract controller class with the basic structure for managing
 * a program following the Model-View-Presenter design pattern.
 * It provides methods to add/remove models that extend the 
 * <tt>AbstractPropertyModel</tt> class  and views that implement the
 * <tt>PropertyChangeView</tt> interface. It is not meant to 
 * be used with other view/model classes that do not apply
 * this MVP framework.
 * <p>
 * In addition to maintaining lists of registered models and views,
 * this class has powerful reflective getter and setter methods to
 * modify the models it is assigned. <tt>setModelProperty(String,Object...)</tt>
 * and <tt>getModelProperty(String,Object...)</tt> are designed to 
 * call upon any public "get" or "set" method in any model class, so long 
 * as the property name is synonymous with the method name. This 
 * allows subclasses to modify the models assigned to this controller
 * without needing any direct knowledge of their implementation.
 * <p>
 * As of Version 2.1, a third reflective method, <tt>invokeModelMethod(String,Object...)</tt>
 * has been provided. This method provides additional reflective method 
 * invoking by not being limited to the setter/getter method naming
 * convention. This provides additional functionality for abstractly
 * interacting with the property models.
 * <p>
 * The only restriction on these two methods is they will only
 * successfully invoke a method that matches the name and parameters
 * provided once. If more than one matching method exists across the instances
 * of the models added to this controller, only the first one found
 * will be invoked. This is to ensure a consistent ability to return
 * a value, if necessary. Because of this, it is highly recommended
 * to keep all property names unique, and not to add multiple instances
 * of the same model to this controller.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, this controller functions as a <tt>PropertyChangeListener</tt>.
 * All models added to this class have this controller added as a
 * listener for any <tt>PropertyChangeEvent</tt>s they fire.
 * Any events received will be passed to all the views registered
 * with this controller. The individual views will be responsible
 * for determining if they need to respond to the event or not.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> This class is completely thread safe. The lists
 * containing the registered models and views are both synchronized 
 * lists, and thread safety is delegated to them. Iteration of 
 * those lists in this class is synchronized on the intrinsic lock
 * of the lists. Any iteration of those lists by subclasses needs 
 * to do the same.
